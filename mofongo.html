        <ul>
            <li>4 Green Plantains</li>
            <li>1 Lb of crucnhy pork skin</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>4 teaspoon of olive oil</li>

        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the plantains, cut them into 1 1/2-inch slices, soak them in salty water for 15 minutes, drain them and dry them before putting them on the hot skillet with oil.</li>
        <p> <li>Fry them for about 12 minutes at medium-low heat or until they turn light brown. Make sure to turn them. Do not brown them too much, so they are easy to mash. Stick a fork in them to check if they are done.</li> </p>
            <li>Remove them and mash them on a mortar. Add some mashed garlic and pieces of chicharr√≥n.</li>
        <p> <li>Once you have mashed all the plantains, mold them into the shape of half sphere using your hands or a container. Serve hot with chicken broth or your favorite meat.</li> </p>
